# Information
The main objective is find the minimum value of the test functions. The functions can bee seen here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization.
The code is implemented in Python and Matlab.
Algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used to find the minimum values of the functions.
